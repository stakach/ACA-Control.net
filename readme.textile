h1. ACA Control.net

Started in 2008 and originally coded in .net, as we wanted to be able to support many languages while still being somewhat cross platform thanks to mono.

h2. What changed

Ruby was always going to be my module writing language of choice however with the rise of HTML5, tablets and websocket support across platforms - a web based interface was seen as the future. Control from any device, no installation needed.
Rails seemed the appropriate platform for interface serving and Mountable engines made this all too easy. Eventmachine reduced the effort required again.


This project was the starting point of our commercial control platform: https://github.com/stakach/em_control
